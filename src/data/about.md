# Intro

I am currently employed as a Blockchain Engineer at Impactility, contributing to Shell Plc's Blockchain Center of Excellence. My role involves actively engaging in research and development initiatives, where I focus on leveraging innovative Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and frameworks. These endeavors aim to enhance transparency and traceability within the renewable energy sector.

My specific area of passion lies in exploring identity solutions that harness the power of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials, and Zero Knowledge Proofs.

I possess proficiency in a range of programming languages, including Typescript, Javascript, and Python. Additionally, I am well-versed in popular frameworks such as ReactJS for front-end development and ExpressJS for back-end solutions. My skill set extends to both front-end and back-end software development, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the full software development lifecycle.

If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause and would like to meet, please feel free to get in touch.
